        <p>Apologies for the above Comic Sans and swapcased blinking marquee. It{"'"}s a hallmark move from my teenage development days.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>I am a dog lover, software engineer, and oxford-comma user based in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

        <p>I received my B.A., Psychology, and M.A., Sociology from <a href={"https://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/01/20/shit-people-say/"}>Stanford University</a>. My thesis was on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwozXzo0MZk">Shit College Freshmen Say</a>.</p>

        <p>After graduation, I pursued standup and improv in LA, performing while training at <a href={"https://www.groundlings.com/"}>Groundlings</a>, <a href={"https://ucbcomedy.com/"}>Upright Citizens Brigrade</a>, and <a href={"https://www.ioimprov.com/"}>iO</a>, while working as a {"premium"} tutor with the goal of getting high school students perfect scores on the SATs.</p>

        <p>I have some experience with social media and community management: creating invite-only communities in high school, being the first student hire to manage {"Stanford\'s"} social media, running <a href={"http://www.facebook.com/Meme"}>facebook.com/Meme</a> and founding a 500,000 member sub-reddit community.</p>
        
<p>I have many disparate interests, including <a href={"https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Comedy-Improvisation-Charna-Halpern/dp/1566080037"}>improv</a>isational thinking, street photography, <a href={"https://fellrnr.com/"}>ultra-endurance</a> sports, social and political theory, and humanistic psychology.</p>

        <p>I have completed the <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago"}>Camino de Santiago</a> and several ultra-endurance events, including a stellar bottom quartile performance at the <a href={"https://calendar.ultrarunning.com/event/burning-man-ultra/race/14235/results"}>Burning Man Ultra-Marathon</a>. </p>

        <p>I was the classic <a href={"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APdSHPBPLLY"}>valedictorian over-achiever</a> in high school. I took 17 APs and 13 college level classes, started an business reselling educational textbooks, spent my summers assisting with research at University of Florida, supported my lavish Olive Gardens weekend dinners through online poker, and worked as a sushi chef apprentice.</p>

        <p>“The value of your travels does not hinge on how many stamps you have in your passport when you get home -- and the slow nuanced experience of a single country is always better than the hurried, superficial experience of forty countries.”<br/>&mdash;Rolf Potts</p>


        <p>I am an avid adventurer and backpack traveler who was traveled to over 40 countries. Some of my memorable experiences I have had include studying spanish and salsa dancing in <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua_Guatemala"}>Antigua, Guatemala</a> for two months, studying abroad in Berlin, hiking <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu"}>Machu Picchu</a> after experiencing an spiritual ceremony in Peru, riding a motorcycle across Vietnam, learning to eat with my right hand and not my left for two months in India, and hiking Nepal's <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapurna_Circuit"}>Annapurna Circuit</a> during a one-year sabbatical trip.</p> 

        <p>In the future, you might see me exploring Russia due to my love of its <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky"}>literature</a>, or taking a truck across sub-Saharan Africa after climbing <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kilimanjaro"}>Mount Kilimanjaro</a>.</p>
